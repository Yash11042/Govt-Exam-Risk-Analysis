#  Government Exam Risk Analysis  
**(Applicants vs Selection Probability)**

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the **risk and competitiveness of Indian government examinations** by evaluating applicant volumes, vacancies, selection probability, preparation time, and salary outcomes. The goal is to use **data-driven insights** to understand whether long-term government exam preparation is a statistically sustainable career path.

The analysis is designed to simulate **real-world analytical decision-making**, similar to how business or policy analysts evaluate risk vs reward.

---

##  Problem Statement
Government exams attract **millions of candidates every year** for a limited number of vacancies. Aspirants often spend **2–3+ years** preparing, with highly uncertain outcomes.

**Key questions addressed:**
- How competitive are major government exams?
- What is the actual probability of selection?
- How many candidates compete for a single seat?
- Does the time investment justify the outcome?

##  Data Description

### Government Exam Dataset
The dataset includes major exams such as:
- SSC (CGL, Phase exams)
- Banking (IBPS PO)
- Railways (RRB Group D, NTPC)
- UPSC (CSE, CDS, NDA)
- State-level police & defence exams

**Key fields:**
- Applicants
- Vacancies
- Selection Rate (%)
- Applicants per Seat
- Average Years of Preparation
- Average Salary (LPA)

>  Data is compiled from publicly available recruitment notifications, reports, and secondary sources. Where exact figures were unavailable, conservative estimates were used and clearly documented.

---

##  Metrics & Feature Engineering
The following analytical metrics were engineered using Python and Power BI:

- **Selection Rate (%)**  
  `Vacancies ÷ Applicants × 100`

- **Applicants per Seat**  
  `Applicants ÷ Vacancies`

- **Average Preparation Time (Years)**

These metrics help quantify **risk, competition intensity, and uncertainty**.

##  Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

The Power BI dashboard includes:

###  KPI Cards
- Average Selection Rate (%)
- Applicants per Seat
- Total Applicants
- Total Vacancies
- Average Years of Preparation

###  Visual Analysis
- Applicants vs Vacancies by Exam
- Selection Rate by Exam (Descending)
- Applicants per Seat by Exam
- Average Preparation Time by Category
- Salary Comparison across Exams

###  Key Insights Panel
- Most major exams have **<1% selection probability**
- **5,000–20,000+ candidates** compete for a single seat
- Aspirants invest **2–3 years** with uncertain outcomes
- High competition significantly increases career risk

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning & feature engineering  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard & storytelling  
- **Excel** – initial data structuring  
- **GitHub** – project documentation & version control  

---

##  Key Findings
- Government exams exhibit **extreme competition** with very low selection rates.
- High preparation time combined with low probability increases opportunity cost.
- Data indicates a **high-risk, low-certainty career model** when evaluated statistically.

---

##  Conclusion
Based on probability, competition intensity, and time investment, government exam preparation represents a **high-risk career path**. A data-driven evaluation highlights the importance of exploring **alternative career options with better risk-to-reward balance**.

---

##  Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Analytical thinking
- Real-world data modeling
- Metric-driven decision making
- Clear storytelling using dashboards

It reflects how **data can be used to make informed personal and business decisions**.
